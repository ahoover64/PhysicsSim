Assignment2: Particle System in Box
Programmer: Kacey Coley
Date: September 23, 2012

Usage:
./assign2 [parameterFile] [emitterParameterFile]


Simulation Bounces particles in the box from an emitter.  The arrow keys and z key changes the gravity force (click and hold).  If loading a parameter file, the gravity, time step, fps, and mass can be changed dynamically.  There is also a parameter file to control the properties of the emitter dynamically.

Keyboard Commands:
u = Update Simulation based on parameter file[s]
h = Change material of the particle
m = Change material colors
Arrow Keys = Change the gravity affecting  the particles in the x(<-- -->)
and y(up or down) directions
z/Z = Change initial velocity in z direction of the particle
l = Toggle to cull face solid color mode/lighting mode
b = Toggle to blend mode
g = Show Grid
n = Draw Normal Vectors
p = Toggle Print parameters
i = Print these instructions
q = Quit Simulation
